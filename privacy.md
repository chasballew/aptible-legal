Aptible, Inc.
=============
Privacy Policy
--------------

Version 1.0 - January 2014

This policy describes Aptible's privacy practices. It is incorporated by reference into the [Terms of Service Agreement](/terms).

When you interact with us (e.g., visit our web site, open our emails, communicate with us, and use the Services, etc.), we collect both information about your usage and information that you explicitly give us to improve the Services and our business processes.

We use this data for two main purposes:

1. To personalize and improve the Services. For example, if usage information indicates that a feature is harder to use or find that we think it should be, we will make changes to that feature.
1. To better explain Aptible's features and the Services. For example, we may use analytics providers such as Kissmetrics or Mixpanel to understand how you use the Services and communicate better with you.

<strong>We will not sell your individually identifiable data to third parties.</strong>

We may share data we collect with third parties, such as analytics providers, for the purpose of improving our Services and business processes. We may also use aggregated, de-identified data for promotional purposes, such as disclosing that X% of our customers are startups, or that Y% of the Fortune 500 uses Aptible, for example.

You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to us may be shared with companies who work on our behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to Aptible and servicing your account. We may also provide information in response to valid legal process, such as subpoenas, search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims. Aptible is not liable for any use or disclosure of such information by such third parties.

We may use or disclose any information we collect to comply with applicable laws or legal processes, to enforce or defend our rights or the rights of others, to protect our property or the property of others, or to enforce this Agreement.
