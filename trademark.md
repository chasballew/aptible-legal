### Limited Permission
Provided that you are in good standing with a current and valid account for use of the Services and provided, further, that you comply at all times with the terms of both the Terms of Service and these Trademark Guidelines, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable permission, under our intellectual property rights in and to the Aptible Marks, and only to the limited extent of our intellectual property rights in and to the Aptible Marks, to use the Aptible Marks for the following limited purpose, and only for such limited purpose:

*You may utilize the Logo or the appropriate form(s) of the "for" or equivalent naming convention or URL naming convention, as set forth below, to:*

- Identify your content and applications (as defined in the Terms of Service) as using the Services; or
- To identify software tools or applications that you create and distribute that are intended for use in connection with the Services.

Without limitation of any provision in the Terms of Service, you acknowledge that any use that you elect to make of the Aptible Marks, even if permitted hereunder, is at your sole risk and that we shall have no liability or responsibility in connection therewith.

Your permission to use the Aptible Marks is a limited permission and you may not use the Aptible Marks for any other purpose. You may not transfer, assign or sublicense your limited permission to use the Aptible Marks to any other person or entity.

- Any other terms, conditions or policies that we may issue from time to time to govern use of the Aptible Marks.

Your permission to use the Aptible Marks hereunder shall automatically terminate and you must immediately stop using the Aptible Marks if at any time:

When using any Aptible Mark (other than the Logo, with respect to which the formatting requirements set forth below, or in a URL), you must distinguish the Aptible Mark from the name of your content and/or other surrounding text by capitalizing the first letter of the Aptible Mark, capitalizing or italicizing the entire Aptible Mark, placing the Aptible Mark in quotes, or using a different style or color of font for the Aptible Mark.

### Formatting Requirements with Respect to the Logo

**Spacing.** The Logo must appear by itself, with reasonable spacing (at least the height of the Logo) between each side of the Logo and other graphic or textual elements.

**Size.** The Logo, as shown in Section 2 of these Trademark Guidelines, indicates the minimum size at which you may display it to ensure that the type and trademark notations are legible. The minimum size for the Logo shall be: Inches: 2.08" x 0.52" Pixels: 150×40, or Millimeters: 53×14.
