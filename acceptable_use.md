This policy describes prohibited uses of the Aptible Services and the website located at https://aptible.com and any subdomains (the "Aptible Site"). It is incorporated by reference into the [Terms of Service Agreement](/terms).

The examples described in this policy are not exhaustive. We may modify this policy at any time by posting a revised version on the Aptible Site. By using the Services or accessing the Aptible Site, you agree to the latest version of this policy. If you violate this policy or authorize or help others to do so, we may suspend or terminate your use of the Services.

<div class="highlight"><strong>We reserve full and final discretion as to whether certain uses violate this Acceptable Use Policy. You agree that our determination is final.</strong></div>


###No Illegal, Harmful, or Offensive Use or Content
You may not use, or encourage, promote, facilitate or instruct others to use, the Services or Aptible Site for any illegal, harmful or offensive use, or to transmit, store, display, distribute or otherwise make available content that is illegal, harmful, or offensive.

Prohibited activities or content include:

1. Illegal Activities: Any illegal activities, including advertising, transmitting, or otherwise making available gambling sites or services or disseminating, promoting or facilitating child pornography.
2. Harmful or Fraudulent Activities: Activities that may be harmful to others, our operations or reputation, including offering or disseminating fraudulent goods, services, schemes, or promotions (e.g., make-money-fast schemes, ponzi and pyramid schemes, phishing, or pharming), or engaging in other deceptive practices.
3. Infringing Content: Content that infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property or proprietary rights of others.
4. Offensive Content: Content that is defamatory, obscene, abusive, invasive of privacy, or otherwise objectionable, including content that constitutes child pornography, relates to bestiality, or depicts non-consensual sex acts.
5. Harmful Content: Content or other computer technology that may damage, interfere with, surreptitiously intercept, or expropriate any system, program, or data, including viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time bombs, or cancelbots.

###No Security Violations
You may not use the Services to violate the security or integrity of any network, computer or communications system, software application, or network or computing device (each, a “System”).

Prohibited activities include:

1. Unauthorized Access: Accessing or using any System without permission, including attempting to probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of a System or to breach any security or authentication measures used by a System.
2. Interception: Monitoring of data or traffic on a System without permission.
3. Falsification of Origin: Forging TCP/IP packet headers, e-mail headers, or any part of a message describing its origin or route. This prohibition does not include the use of aliases or anonymous remailers.

### No Network Abuse
You may not make network connections to any users, hosts, or networks unless you have permission to communicate with them.

Prohibited activities include:

1. Monitoring or Crawling: Monitoring or crawling of a System that impairs or disrupts the System being monitored or crawled.
2. Denial of Service (DoS): Inundating a target with communications requests so the target either cannot respond to legitimate traffic or responds so slowly that it becomes ineffective.
3. Intentional Interference: Interfering with the proper functioning of any System, including any deliberate attempt to overload a system by mail bombing, news bombing, broadcast attacks, or flooding techniques.
4. Operation of Certain Network Services: Operating network services like open proxies, open mail relays, or open recursive domain name servers.
5. Avoiding System Restrictions: Using manual or electronic means to avoid any use limitations placed on a System, such as access and storage restrictions.
6. Domain Impersonation: Creating applications pointing at domains you do not own or lawfully control.

###No E-Mail or Other Message Abuse
You will not distribute, publish, send, or facilitate the sending of unsolicited mass e-mail or other messages, promotions, advertising, or solicitations (like “spam”), including commercial advertising and informational announcements. You will not alter or obscure mail headers or assume a sender’s identity without the sender’s explicit permission. You will not collect replies to messages sent from another Internet service provider if those messages violate this policy or the acceptable use policy of that provider.

###Our Monitoring and Enforcement
We reserve the right, but do not assume the obligation, to investigate any violation of this policy or misuse of the Services or Aptible Site. We may:

1. Investigate violations of this policy or misuse of the Services or Aptible Site;
2. Remove, disable access to, or modify any content or resource that violates this Policy or any other agreement we have with you for use of the Services or the Aptible Site; and
