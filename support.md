Aptible, Inc.
=============
Support Policy
--------------
Version 1.0 - January 2014

This policy outlines Aptible's support practices and resources. It also identifies your support obligations to your customers. It is incorporated by reference into the [Terms of Service Agreement](/terms).

### Deprecation
We will announce if we intend to discontinue or make backwards incompatible changes to any Service. We will always try to give you as much time as possible to make any necessary modifications to your applications or processes. This policy does not apply to versions, features, and functionality that we label as "experimental."

### Documentation
We may provide documentation for the Services and their use. Our documentation may specify restrictions on how Applications may be built or configured. You agree to comply with any such restrictions as specified. Visit <%= docs_url %> or <%= help_path %> for all of our support and documentation resources.

### End User Support
You are responsible for providing customer service (if any) to End Users. We do not provide any support or services to End Users unless we have a separate agreement with you or an End User for the provision of such services.

### Monitoring
Aptible's systems are continuously monitored by automated systems and health checks. In the event of any issue that adversely affects the performance, security, reliability, or integrity of the Services, we will receive notification and respond immediately. Check <http://status.aptible.com> for current service status.

### Technical support
We offer limited free technical support. Visit <%= help_path %> or email us at <help@aptible.com>. 

This free support does not cover debugging of user applications or rewriting your code to be compatible with the Services. That level of support is available with an [Enterprise account](<%= enterprise_url %>).
