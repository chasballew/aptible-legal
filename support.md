Aptible, Inc.
=============
Support Policy
--------------
Version 2.0 - July 2014

This policy outlines Aptible's support practices and resources. It also identifies your support obligations to your customers. It is incorporated by reference into the Aptible Terms of Service.

### Deprecation
We will announce if we intend to discontinue or make backwards incompatible changes to any Service. We will always try to give you as much time as possible to make any necessary modifications to your applications or processes. This policy does not apply to versions, features, and functionality that we label as "beta" or "experimental."

### Documentation
We may provide documentation for the Services and their use. Our documentation may specify restrictions on how Applications may be built or configured. You agree to comply with any such restrictions as specified. Visit https://support.aptible.com for access to our support and documentation resources.

### End User Support
You are responsible for providing customer service (if any) to End Users. We do not provide any support or services to End Users unless we have a separate agreement with you or an End User for the provision of such services.

### Monitoring
Aptible's systems are continuously monitored by automated systems and health checks. In the event of any issue that adversely affects the performance, security, reliability, or integrity of the Services, we will receive notification and respond immediately. Check http://status.aptible.com for the current status of our services.

### Technical support
We offer limited free technical support. Visit https://support.aptible.com or email us at support@aptible.com. This free support does not include debugging of user applications or rewriting your code to be compatible with the Services.
