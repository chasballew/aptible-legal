Aptible, Inc.
=============
Security Policy & Practices
---------------------
Version 3.0 - December 2015

This policy outlines: 1) Aptible's security practices and resources, and 2)  your security obligations. This policy is incorporated by reference into the Aptible Terms of Service.

### Your Obligations
Our documentation may specify restrictions on how Applications may be built or configured. You agree to comply with any such restrictions as specified.

You are responsible for properly configuring and using the Services and taking your own steps to maintain appropriate security, protection and backup of Your Content, which may include the use of encryption technology to protect Your Content from unauthorized access and routinely archiving Your Content. Where security controls or data backup are offered as part of the Services, you are responsible for implementing those features according to our instructions. You are ultimately responsible for determining the sufficiency of the security controls applied to your Applications and data.

Aptible access credentials and private keys generated by the Services are for your internal use only. You may not sell, transfer or sublicense them to any other entity or person, except that you may disclose your private key to your agents and subcontractors performing work on your behalf.

Pursuant to Section 2 of the Aptible Terms of Service, you will not use the Services to create, receive, maintain, or transmit electronic protected health information, as defined in 45 C.F.R. ยง 160.103, without a Business Associate Agreement in place between you and Aptible.

### Reporting Security Vulnerabilities
If you discover a potential security vulnerability, please see our policy on [Responsible Disclosure](http://www.aptible.com/legal/responsible_disclosure.html). We strongly prefer that you notify us in private. Publicly disclosing a security vulnerability without informing us first puts the community at risk. When you notify us of a potential problem, we will work with you to make sure we understand the scope and cause of the issue. Thank you!

### Our Obligations
Without limiting any provision of the Aptible Terms of Service, we will implement reasonable and appropriate measures designed to help you secure Your Content against accidental or unlawful loss, access or disclosure.

### Our Security Practices
Aptible manages information security using the ISO/IEC 27001:2013 framework, which specifies the requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually improving a comprehensive information security management system and risk management capabilities.

#### **1. Data Center Security**
Aptible runs on the Amazon Web Services global infrastructure platform. 

AWS publishes an ["Overview of Security Processes" whitepaper](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Security/AWS_Security_Whitepaper.pdf) that serves as the reference material for this section. SOC 2 reports are available directly from AWS upon request.

##### **1.A - Compliance**
> AWS computing environments are continuously audited, with certifications from accreditation bodies across geographies and verticals, including ISO 27001, FedRAMP, DoD CSM, and PCI DSS. Additionally AWS also has assurance programs that provide templates and control mappings to help customers establish the compliance of their environments running on AWS against 20+ standards, including the HIPAA, CESG (UK), and Singapore Multi-tier Cloud Security (MTCS) standards.

##### **1.B - Physical Security**
> AWS data centers are housed in nondescript facilities. Physical access is strictly controlled both at the perimeter and at building ingress points by professional security staff utilizing video surveillance, intrusion detection systems, and other electronic means. Authorized staff must pass two-factor authentication a minimum of two times to access data center floors. All visitors and contractors are required to present identification and are signed in and continually escorted by authorized staff.

p. 8 - ["Amazon Web Services: Overview of Security Processes - August 2015"](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Security/AWS_Security_Whitepaper.pdf)

##### **1.C - Environmental Security**
AWS data center environmental controls include:
- Fire detection and suppression systems
- Redundant power systems, backed by Uninterruptible Power Supply units and generators
- Climate and temperature controls
- Active system monitoring

#### **2. Network Security**
Please see our [Reference Architecture Diagram](/pages/assets/aptible-reference-architecture.pdf) and [FAQ](/faq) for an explanation of the terms in this section.

##### **2.A - Secure Architecture**
Aptible stacks run in separate AWS Virtual Private Clouds. Each stack is an isolated network. Most services run in a private subnet. Only SSL/TLS endpoints and a bastion host are exposed to the Internet. Backend users connect to the stack through the bastion host, which restricts access to stack components and logs activity for security review. 

##### **2.B - Firewalls**
All stack hosts run mandatory inbound firewalls configured in deny-all mode. HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH ports are opened as necessary.

##### **2.C - DDoS Protection and Mitigation**
Aptible's VPC-based approach means that most stack components are not accessible from the Internet, and cannot be targeted directly by a DDoS attack.

Aptible SSL/TLS endpoints include an AWS Elastic Load Balancer, which only supports valid TCP requests, meaning DDoS attacks such as UDP and SYN floods will not reach your app layer.

Should you need to add capacity to deal with a potential attack, you can instantly scale your stack using the Aptible dashboard or command line tool.

##### **2.D - Port Scanning**
AWS monitors and stops unauthorized port scanning. Because most of an Aptible stack is private, and all hosts run strict firewalls, port scanning is generally ineffective.

##### **2.E - Spoofing & Sniffing**
The AWS network prohibits a host from sending traffic with a source IP or MAC address other than its own. The AWS hypervisor will also not deliver any traffic to a host the traffic is not addressed to, meaning even an instance running in promiscuous mode will not receive or be able to "sniff" traffic intended for other hosts.

p. 13 - ["Amazon Web Services: Overview of Security Processes - August 2015"](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Security/AWS_Security_Whitepaper.pdf)

##### **2.F - Intrusion Detection & Prevention**
You may choose to run a host-based intrusion detection or prevention system that can be managed externally, such as AlertLogic, as an add-on. Aptible will ensure the host agents run and can connect to your external management service. You are responsible for procuring a license and operating the system.

#### **3. Platform Security**
##### **3.A - Configuration and Change Management**
For app services that have a VHOST (SSL/TLS endpoint) attached, the Aptible platform performs a health check on the container set before promoting it to the current release. If the health check fails, the container set is not promoted. Either way, the deploy is zero-downtime.

For any deploy, you can roll back to a previous codebase by pushing a different ref to your Aptible git endpoint.

##### **3.B - Isolation**
PHI-ready environments are deployed on stacks isolated at the customer level. The VPC, network, underlying instances, and AWS virtual infrastructure are not shared with any other tenant.

##### **3.C - Access Management and Restrictions**
Aptible workforce members are only granted administrative privileges on customer stacks on an as-needed, least-privilege basis. Access reviews are performed on a regular basis.

##### **3.D - Logging and Monitoring**
Aptible logs AWS and Aptible API activity, and host activity within your stack. The Aptible platform monitors performance indicators such as disk, memory, compute, and logging issues, and automatically resolves them on your behalf.

##### **3.E - Security Assessments**
Aptible conducts regular security and vulnerability assessments of stack hosts and our applications. Code undergoes automated testing and manual code review prior to being deployed to production. Our security team receives regular notifications of vulnerabilities and patches on a continuous basis.

Aptible also operates a [responsible disclosure program](https://www.aptible.com/legal/responsible_disclosure.html) for security vulnerabilities, with cash bounties. 

You are responsible for app-level security of the apps you deploy to Aptible.

##### **3.F - Customer Code**
SSH public key authentication is used to limit access to your authorized backend users during git-based deploys. Following a successful push to an Aptible git endpoint, code is copied down to your stack's build layer. The resulting images are pushed to a private stack registry, backed by AWS S3, which provides redundant, access-controlled storage.

##### **3.G - Databases**
Databases run in the database layer of your stack, on a private subnet accessible only from app or bastion layer. SSL/TLS is required if the database protocol supports it. Disk volumes backing databases are encrypted at the filesystem level using Aptible-managed AES 192-bit encryption. 

#### **4. Contingency Planning**
##### **4.A - Backups**
Your account information, configuration data (such as environment variables), access logs, and operation history are stored in our API databases, which are backed up no less than every 24 hours, with a 7 day retention period.

Database disk volumes in PHI-ready environments are backed up nightly with differential snapshots. Backups are stored in a separate geographic region. Write-ahead logging is enabled for databases that support it, enabling recovery within seconds of failure.

Copies of your app repositories are stored in the Aptible API and in the build layer of your stack. The resulting Docker images are stored in the build layer of your stack and in a private Docker registry, backed by S3. The Aptible platform uses these to automatically recover your apps in the event of an availability incident. 

You are responsible for maintaining the canonical version of your code.

##### **4.B - Fault Tolerance**
AWS data centers are clustered into regions, and sub-clustered into availability zones, each of which is designed as an independent failure zone, meaning they are:

- Physically separated
- Located in lower-risk flood plains
- Equipped with independent uninterruptable power supplies and onsite backup generators
- Fed via different grids from independent utilities, and
- Redundantly connected to multiple tier-1 transit providers

For PHI-ready environments, Aptible automatically distributes app containers across availability zones when a service is scaled to more than one container.

##### **4.C - High Availability**
Aptible supports high-availability configuration of databases that support it.

##### **4.D - Disaster Recovery**
The Aptible platform automatically recovers apps and databases from most failure scenarios. Raw database snapshots and restored database clones are available upon request for testing and recovery.
