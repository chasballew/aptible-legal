Aptible, Inc.
=============
Fees & Pricing Policy
--------------

Version 1.0 - January 2014

This policy outlines how Aptible determines fees and charges for services. It is incorporated by reference into the [Terms of Service Agreement](/terms).

### Organizations
An Organization represents an potentially regulated entity, like a business or a non-profit. All Aptible user accounts are managed through Organizations. When you sign up for Aptible, you have the option of creating a new Organization, which comes with one Development Account by default. When you are ready to go live with patient data, you can add a Production Account to the Organization.

### Development Accounts
Fees and charges for Development Accounts are based solely on the resources used. Current pricing information is located at www.aptible.com/pricing.

### Production Accounts
Fees and charges for Production Accounts are based on the resources used, subject to a monthly minimum. You will be billed the minimum at the beginning of each month, along with fees for any additional resources consumed during the previous month. Current pricing information is located at www.aptible.com/pricing.

### Changes
Fees and charges for any new Service or new feature of a Service will be effective when we post updated fees and charges on www.aptible.com unless we expressly state otherwise in a notice. We may increase or add new fees and charges for any existing Services by giving you at least 30 daysâ€™ advance notice before the beginning of the billing cycle in which such change will take effect.

### Late Payments
Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less).

### Thank You
Thank for you being an Aptible customer. We sincerely appreciate your business!
